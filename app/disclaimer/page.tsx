					<section className="mb-8">
						<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">1. Platform Purpose and Nature</h2>

							View Market is exclusively a software tool provider that offers charting platforms, technical analysis tools, and trading software solutions. Our platform is designed to provide users with professional-grade tools for market analysis and chart visualization. We do not operate as a financial institution, brokerage firm, investment advisor, or financial services provider in any capacity.
						</p>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
							Our services are limited to providing software tools and technical resources that users can utilize for their own analysis and decision-making processes. We develop, maintain, and distribute software applications that facilitate chart creation, technical indicator analysis, and data visualization. The platform serves as a technological solution for users who require advanced charting capabilities.
						</p>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
							All features, functionalities, and tools provided through our platform are intended for informational and analytical purposes only.

					{/* No Financial Advice */}
					<section className="mb-8">
						<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">2. No Financial Advice or Recommendations</h2>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
							View Market explicitly does not provide financial advice, investment recommendations, trading suggestions, or market insights of any kind. Our platform does not offer opinions on market direction, security valuations, investment strategies, or trading decisions. We do not analyze market conditions, predict price movements, or suggest investment opportunities.
						</p>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
							Any information displayed through our software tools, including charts, indicators, or data visualizations, should not be construed as investment advice or trading recommendations. These tools simply present data in various formats to assist users in their own analysis. We do not endorse any particular trading strategy, investment approach, or market position.
						</p>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
							Users are solely responsible for their own investment decisions and should consult with qualified financial professionals before making any trading or investment choices. View Market&apos;s software tools are provided as neutral analytical resources, and users must conduct their own due diligence and risk assessment before taking any financial actions based on information processed through our platform.
						</p>
					</section>

					{/* Tool Provider Status */}
					<section className="mb-8">
						<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">3. Software Tool Provider Status</h2>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
							View Market operates exclusively as a software tool provider, offering technological solutions for data analysis and visualization. Our business model is centered on developing, licensing, and maintaining software applications that users can employ for their own analytical purposes. We do not participate in financial markets, execute trades, or provide brokerage services.
						</p>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
							Our platform provides tools such as charting software, technical indicators, drawing tools, and data visualization features. These tools are designed to help users organize, analyze, and present market data according to their own requirements and preferences. We focus solely on the technical aspects of software development and user interface design.
						</p>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
							The relationship between View Market and our users is purely that of a software vendor and customer. We provide technological tools and ongoing technical support for those tools, but we do not engage in any form of financial advisory relationship or investment management services. Our expertise lies in software development and platform maintenance, not in financial markets or investment strategies.
						</p>

					{/* Accuracy Limitations */}
					<section className="mb-8">
						<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">4. Data Accuracy and Limitations</h2>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
							While we strive to provide accurate and reliable software tools, View Market cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of any data processed through our platform. Market data, charts, and analytical outputs are subject to various factors including data source reliability, transmission delays, and technical limitations that may affect accuracy.
						</p>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
							Our software tools rely on third-party data feeds and external sources for market information. We do not control these data sources and cannot be held responsible for any errors, omissions, or delays in the underlying data. Users should verify important information through multiple sources and should not rely solely on data presented through our platform.
						</p>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
							Technical indicators, calculations, and analytical tools provided by our software are based on mathematical formulas and algorithms. While these tools are designed to function correctly, users should understand their limitations and verify results when making important decisions. As a tool provider, we focus on software functionality rather than the interpretation or validation of analytical results.
						</p>
					</section>

					{/* User Responsibility */}
					<section className="mb-8">
						<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">5. User Responsibility and Decision Making</h2>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
							Users of View Market&apos;s software tools are entirely responsible for their own analysis, interpretation, and decision-making processes. Our platform provides tools for data visualization and technical analysis, but users must apply their own knowledge, experience, and judgment when using these tools. We do not guide or influence user decisions in any way.
						</p>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
							Users are responsible for understanding the functionality and limitations of each tool before using it for analysis. This includes understanding how technical indicators work, what data sources are being used, and how to properly interpret the output. Users should educate themselves about the tools they choose to use and should not rely on our software without proper understanding.
						</p>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
							Any financial decisions made by users are their sole responsibility. View Market, as a software tool provider, does not participate in or influence these decisions. Users should conduct their own research, seek professional advice when appropriate, and carefully consider their risk tolerance before making any investment or trading decisions based on analysis conducted using our tools.
						</p>
					</section>

					{/* Third-party Content */}
					<section className="mb-8">
						<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">6. Third-Party Content and Data Sources</h2>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
							Our platform may integrate with or display content from third-party data providers, news sources, or other external services. View Market does not control, endorse, or take responsibility for any third-party content, opinions, or information that may be accessible through our software tools. We serve only as a conduit for displaying this information within our analytical framework.
						</p>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
							Third-party content, including news articles, analyst reports, or market commentary, represents the views and opinions of their respective authors and publishers, not those of View Market. We do not verify, validate, or endorse any third-party content and users should evaluate such content independently using their own judgment and research.
						</p>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
							Users acknowledge that third-party data sources may have their own terms of use, licensing restrictions, and disclaimers. View Market&apos;s role is limited to providing the technical infrastructure to access and display this information within our software environment. We are not responsible for the accuracy, reliability, or availability of third-party content or services.

					{/* Technical Risks */}
					<section className="mb-8">
						<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">7. Technical Risks and Software Limitations</h2>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
							As with any software platform, View Market&apos;s tools may experience technical issues, downtime, bugs, or other operational problems that could affect functionality. Users acknowledge that software systems are inherently subject to technical limitations and that perfect reliability cannot be guaranteed. We work diligently to maintain system stability but cannot eliminate all technical risks.
						</p>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
							Internet connectivity, server performance, data feed interruptions, and other technical factors beyond our control may impact the availability or performance of our software tools. Users should have contingency plans and should not rely exclusively on our platform for time-sensitive analysis or decision-making processes.
						</p>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
							Software updates, maintenance, and system improvements may occasionally require temporary service interruptions. While we strive to minimize disruptions and provide advance notice when possible, users should be prepared for occasional technical limitations. As a tool provider, our primary focus is on maintaining and improving software functionality, but we cannot guarantee uninterrupted service.
						</p>

					{/* Liability Limitations */}
					<section className="mb-8">
						<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
							View Market&apos;s liability is strictly limited to the provision of software tools and technical support services. We shall not be liable for any financial losses, investment decisions, trading outcomes, or other consequences resulting from the use of our platform. Our responsibility is limited to ensuring that our software tools function as designed and providing technical assistance when needed.
						</p>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
							Users acknowledge that any financial or investment decisions made using our tools are made at their own risk and discretion. View Market shall not be held responsible for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages arising from the use of our software, regardless of whether such damages were foreseeable or whether we were advised of their possibility.
						</p>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
							In jurisdictions where liability limitations are not permitted, our liability shall be limited to the maximum extent allowed by law. Our total liability for any claims related to our software tools shall not exceed the amount paid by the user for access to our platform during the twelve months preceding the claim. This limitation reflects our role as a software tool provider rather than a financial services provider.
						</p>
