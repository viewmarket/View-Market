					{/* No Refund Policy */}
					<section className="mb-8">
						<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">1. No Refund Policy</h2>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
							View Market operates a strict no-refund policy for all software subscriptions, purchases, and services. Once payment has been processed for access to our analytical tools and software platform, no refunds will be provided under any circumstances. This policy applies to all subscription plans, one-time purchases, and any additional services or features offered through our platform.
						</p>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
							All sales are final, and users acknowledge this no-refund policy at the time of purchase. By completing any transaction with View Market, you explicitly agree that you will not be entitled to any refund, partial refund, or credit for unused portions of your subscription or service period. This policy is clearly communicated during the purchase process and is an integral part of our terms of service.
						</p>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
							View Market reserves the right to refuse refund requests regardless of the circumstances, timing, or reasons provided. This includes situations where users are dissatisfied with the software tools, experience technical difficulties, or decide they no longer need our services. The no-refund policy is enforced consistently and applies to all users without exception.
						</p>
					</section>

					{/* Software Nature Explanation */}
					<section className="mb-8">
						<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">2. Software-Based Service Nature</h2>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
							View Market provides software-based analytical tools and platforms that are delivered digitally and accessed immediately upon subscription activation. Unlike physical products that can be returned, our software services are intangible digital products that cannot be &quot;returned&quot; once access has been granted. The nature of software services makes traditional refund concepts inapplicable to our business model.
						</p>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
							Our analytical tools and software platform provide immediate value upon access, and users can begin utilizing features, creating analyses, and benefiting from our tools as soon as their subscription is activated. The instant delivery and immediate availability of our software services justify our no-refund policy, as users receive the full value of their purchase from the moment of activation.
						</p>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
							As a software tool provider, View Market invests significant resources in developing, maintaining, and improving our analytical platform. The costs associated with software development, server infrastructure, data feeds, and ongoing platform maintenance are incurred regardless of individual user satisfaction, making refunds financially unsustainable for our business model.
						</p>
					</section>

					{/* Subscription Terms */}
					<section className="mb-8">
						<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">3. Subscription Terms and Billing</h2>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
							All subscription fees are charged in advance for the selected billing period and are non-refundable once processed. Monthly subscriptions are billed monthly in advance, annual subscriptions are billed annually in advance, and any other billing cycles follow the same advance payment structure. Users receive full access to our software tools for the entire paid period, regardless of actual usage.
						</p>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
							Subscription renewals are processed automatically unless cancelled before the next billing cycle. Even if a subscription is cancelled, no refund will be provided for the current billing period, and users retain access to our software tools until the end of their paid subscription term. Cancellation only prevents future billing cycles and does not entitle users to any refund for the current period.
						</p>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
							Users are responsible for managing their subscription status and cancelling before unwanted renewals. View Market provides clear information about billing dates and renewal schedules, and users can access their subscription management tools through their account dashboard. Failure to cancel before renewal does not constitute grounds for a refund of the renewal charges.
						</p>
					</section>

					{/* Exceptional Circumstances */}
					<section className="mb-8">
						<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">4. Exceptional Circumstances</h2>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
							While View Market maintains a strict no-refund policy, we may, at our sole discretion, consider exceptional circumstances on a case-by-case basis. However, users should not expect refunds under any circumstances, and any consideration of exceptional cases does not establish precedent or obligation for future situations. Such considerations are rare and entirely at our discretion.
						</p>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
							Exceptional circumstances do not include user dissatisfaction, changes in personal financial situation, lack of usage, technical difficulties that can be resolved through support, or any other common reasons users might request refunds. Our definition of exceptional circumstances is extremely limited and typically relates only to significant platform failures or legal requirements.
						</p>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
							Even in cases where exceptional circumstances might be considered, View Market reserves the right to offer alternative solutions such as service credits, extended access periods, or technical support rather than monetary refunds. Any resolution offered in exceptional circumstances is provided as a gesture of goodwill and does not constitute an admission of liability or obligation.
						</p>
					</section>

					{/* Cancellation Process */}
					<section className="mb-8">
						<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">5. Subscription Cancellation Process</h2>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
							Users can cancel their subscriptions at any time through their account dashboard or by contacting our support team. Cancellation prevents future billing cycles but does not provide any refund for the current billing period. Once cancelled, users will continue to have access to our software tools until the end of their current paid subscription term.
						</p>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
							To avoid unwanted charges, users must cancel their subscriptions before the next billing date. View Market provides clear information about upcoming billing dates and sends reminder notifications, but users are ultimately responsible for managing their subscription status. Cancellation requests must be submitted with sufficient time before the next billing cycle.
						</p>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
							After cancellation, users will receive confirmation of the cancellation and information about when their access to our software tools will expire. No refund will be provided for the remaining time in the current billing period, and users are encouraged to continue using our analytical tools until their access expires to maximize the value of their payment.
						</p>
					</section>

					{/* Billing Disputes */}
					<section className="mb-8">
						<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">6. Billing Disputes and Chargebacks</h2>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
							Users who dispute charges or initiate chargebacks through their financial institutions will have their access to View Market&apos;s software platform immediately suspended or terminated. Chargeback disputes are considered a violation of our terms of service, as users have received the software services they paid for and agreed to our no-refund policy at the time of purchase.
						</p>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
							View Market will actively contest all chargeback disputes and provide evidence of service delivery, terms acceptance, and policy acknowledgment to financial institutions. Users who initiate chargebacks may be permanently banned from using our software platform and may be held liable for additional fees and costs associated with chargeback processing.
						</p>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
							If users have concerns about billing or charges, they should contact our support team directly rather than disputing charges with their financial institution. While we maintain our no-refund policy, we are committed to addressing legitimate billing concerns and providing clear explanations of charges. However, this does not constitute an offer of refunds.
						</p>
					</section>

					{/* Service Credits */}
					<section className="mb-8">
						<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">7. Service Credits and Alternative Remedies</h2>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
							In rare cases where View Market determines that service credits or alternative remedies are appropriate, these will be provided as account credits for future use of our software platform rather than monetary refunds. Service credits, if offered, cannot be converted to cash, transferred to other accounts, or refunded under any circumstances.
						</p>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
							Service credits are issued at View Market&apos;s sole discretion and typically only in cases of significant platform downtime or technical issues that prevent access to our software tools for extended periods. The value and terms of any service credits are determined by View Market and may not equal the full value of affected subscription periods.
						</p>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
							Service credits expire after a specified period and cannot be used indefinitely. Users must utilize service credits within the designated timeframe, or they will be forfeited. The issuance of service credits in any situation does not establish precedent for future issues or create any obligation for View Market to provide similar remedies in other circumstances.
						</p>
					</section>

					{/* Contact Information */}
					<section className="mb-8">
						<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">8. Contact Information for Policy Questions</h2>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
							Users who have questions about our refund policy or need clarification about billing practices can contact our support team through the designated channels provided on our platform. However, contacting support does not constitute a refund request, and our support team cannot override our no-refund policy or authorize refunds under any circumstances.
						</p>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
							Our support team can provide information about subscription management, billing schedules, cancellation procedures, and policy explanations, but they cannot process refunds or make exceptions to our established policies. All support interactions are subject to our terms of service and this refund policy.
						</p>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
							For technical issues or problems with our software tools, our support team will work to resolve issues and ensure users can access the features they have paid for. Technical support is provided to help users maximize the value of their subscription, but technical difficulties do not constitute grounds for refunds under our policy.
						</p>
					</section>

					{/* Policy Updates */}
					<section className="mb-8">
						<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">9. Policy Updates and Modifications</h2>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
							View Market reserves the right to modify this refund policy at any time without prior notice to users. Policy changes will be effective immediately upon posting to our website, and continued use of our software platform constitutes acceptance of any policy modifications. Users are responsible for reviewing this policy periodically to stay informed of any changes.
						</p>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
							Changes to our refund policy will not affect the terms under which previous purchases were made, but will apply to all future transactions and renewals. Users who do not agree with policy changes should cancel their subscriptions before the next billing cycle to avoid being subject to the updated terms.
						</p>
						<p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
							This refund policy is an integral part of our terms of service and user agreement. Any conflicts between this policy and other terms will be resolved in favor of the most restrictive interpretation regarding refunds. View Market&apos;s commitment to providing software tools does not extend to providing refunds under any circumstances.
						</p>
